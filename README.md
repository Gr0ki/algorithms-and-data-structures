Here is a project for practising on Computer Science.


Text below will navigate you throw project structure:

1. path: /Algorithms/binary_search/binary_search.py - 
This script helps to compare different search algorithms with binary search in terms of efficiency.
Here binary_search is a main file and parser.py is a dependency module(parse a list of names from a
web-site for further tests).

2. path: /data_structures/linked_list/main.py -
This is a test of creating and using Linked List.

3. path: /data_structures/doubly_linked_list/main.py -
This is a test of creating and using Doubly Linked List.
